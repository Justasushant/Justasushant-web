1. On-Page SEO Enhancements (Your Code)
Title & Meta Description

Make sure each page has a unique, keyword-rich title and meta description:

<title>Sushant Sharma — Frontend Developer & React Specialist</title>
<meta name="description" content="Sushant Sharma, frontend developer specializing in React, TypeScript, and responsive designs. Explore projects, portfolio, and contact me.">

Structured Headings

Use semantic structure to guide crawlers:

<h1>Sushant Sharma — Frontend Developer</h1>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<h2>Contact</h2>

Image Alt Text & Open Graph Tags

Add descriptive alt text and OG tags for better visibility and sharability:

<img src="avatar.png" alt="Sushant Sharma — Developer using laptop">

<meta property="og:title" content="Sushant Sharma — Frontend Developer">
<meta property="og:description" content="Building responsive web applications with React and modern tools.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://sushantsharma.me/avatar-preview.png">

Internal Linking

Connect your site’s sections (e.g., “About” → “Contact”) with anchor links to boost crawlability.

2. Technical SEO (Infrastructure)

Sitemap & Robots:
Create a sitemap.xml and a robots.txt to guide bots:

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://sushantsharma.me/sitemap.xml


Structured Data (JSON-LD):
Help search engines recognize you properly:

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"Person",
  "name":"Sushant Sharma",
  "url":"https://sushantsharma.me",
  "jobTitle":"Frontend Developer",
  "sameAs":[
    "https://github.com/yourhandle",
    "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile"
  ]
}
</script>


Page Speed & Mobile-Friendliness:
Compress images, defer heavy scripts, lazy-load assets, and ensure responsiveness across devices.

3. Off-Page SEO (Getting Your Name Out)

Backlinks:
Share your portfolio on relevant forums, GitHub profile, LinkedIn, and developer communities.

Consistency of Name:
Ensure that everywhere you're mentioned online, it's always “Sushant Sharma” the developer (avoiding doctor or medical profiles, which may dilute your relevance) 
directory.hsc.wvu.edu
.

Social Meta Tags:
Add Twitter Card tags to improve link previews when shared:

<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Sushant Sharma — Frontend Developer">
